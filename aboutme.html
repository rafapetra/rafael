    <p>I am originally from <em>SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil</em> and have been living in the US for over ten years.</p><p>I currently live in <em>Portland, OR</em> and I decided to take a class on programming for various reasons: I simply enjoy it and used to do it as a hobbie when I was a teenager. </p><p>I have a BA in Media Studies from <span class="highlight">Portland State University</span> and after working in various industries, I am seeking a career change that would allow me to work remotely and visit my family more often.</p><p> Besides coding, I am passionate about nature, movies, music and drawing. 

      I also enjoy graphic design and video editing using Adobe Creative Cloud.<br><br>
      Any questions please contact me,<br><br>
